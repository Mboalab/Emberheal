# EmberHeal :Â Pioneering Accessibility and Efficiency in Healthcare 


### â™¦ Background : 
Healthcare is a fundamental human right, yet millions of people around the world lack access to quality and affordable care. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is a global shortage of 18 million health workers, especially in low and middle-income countries. This gap leads to increased workload and stress for existing providers, as well as reduced quality and efficiency of care for patients.

### â™¦ Solution : 
With the rise in hospital traffic and resource shortages, particularly in developing nations, there is a pressing need for innovative solutions. â€˜EmberHealâ€™ is our answer to this challenge, offering an intuitive patient entry system and leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning and computer vision technologies to enhance healthcare delivery.

### â™¦ About EmberHeal :Â 

The main users of our mobile app are healthcare providers, although it's important to note that there's a distinction between healthcare providers and doctors. Our app's aim is to support healthcare workers in critical situations, without implying that patients shouldn't seek medical attention from doctors.

Healthcare workers will utilize the app to easily and securely input patient records digitally, eliminating the need for outdated manual methods or unsafe paper storage.Â This feature is especially beneficial in Tier-II and Tier-III areas where language barriers exist.

We offer a machine learning-powered "soft diagnosis" feature to assist doctors and nurses in saving time. Essentially, healthcare workers can input patient information through audio, which we then analyze to provide a list of the top-k detected symptoms. Based on this analysis, we offer suggestions for actions to take and avoid.

Rest aside, our app includes an intuitive system for actively monitoring patients and sending reminders for medication and check-ups. This feature is particularly useful in chaotic situations where keeping track of everything can be challenging.



### â™¦ Aim and Vision : 
Our aim with â€˜EmberHealâ€™ is to streamline healthcare management, particularly in resource-constrained settings. We envision a future where access to quality healthcare is unaffected by language barriers or geographical distances. Through automated note-keeping, multilingual transcribing, and soft diagnoses, we aim to enhance the accessibility and efficiency of healthcare.
