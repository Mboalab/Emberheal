## Hello 👋🏻

Hey there! I'm [Pratyay Banerjee](https://neilblaze.live), an Electronics engineering grad transitioning to an Informatics Master's program. I'm passionate about Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and applied Machine Learning. I love open-source software and was a Google Summer of Code mentee last year under TensorFlow. Currently, I'm working as an R&D Engineer at Boston University, focusing on developing techniques to tackle online harms and contributing to platform governance. Besides, I'm also involved in a research project at NYU, creating open-source chatbots for females in Bangladesh to address menstrual queries.

Driven by curiosity, I thrive on continuous learning and aim to create positive impacts. Excited to volunteer as a mentor for *EmberHeal* and contribute to making a difference! 🚀
